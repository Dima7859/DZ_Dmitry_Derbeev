                            Humans (Homo sapiens) are a species of highly intelligent primates.
                            They are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina and—together with chimpanzees, gorillas,
                            and orangutans—are part of the family Hominidae (the great apes, or hominids). Humans are terrestrial animals, 
                            characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; 
                            open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications; larger, more complex brains than other primates; and highly 
                            advanced and organized societies. <br>
                            Several early hominins used fire and occupied much of Eurasia. Early modern humans are thought to have diverged in Africa 
                            from an earlier hominin around 300,000 years ago, with the earliest fossil evidence of Homo sapiens also appearing around 
                            300,000 years ago in Africa.[5] Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity at least by about 150,000–75,000 years ago 
                            and possibly earlier. In several waves of migration, H. sapiens ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world.
                            The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected the biosphere and millions of species worldwide. 
                            Among the key advantages that explain this evolutionary success is the presence of a larger, well-developed brain, which enables advanced 
                            abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, sociality, and culture through social learning. Humans use tools more frequently and effectively 
                            than any other animal: they are the only extant species to build fires, cook food, clothe themselves, and create and use numerous other 
                            technologies and arts. <br>
                            Humans uniquely use systems of symbolic communication such as language and art to express themselves and exchange ideas, 
                            as well as to organize themselves into purposeful groups. Humans create complex social structures composed of many cooperating and 
                            competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely 
                            wide variety of values,[13] social norms, and rituals, which together undergird human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and 
                            influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena have motivated humanity's development of science, philosophy, mythology, 
                            religion, and other fields of knowledge. <br>
                            Though most of human existence has been sustained by hunting and gathering in band societies,[14] many human societies 
                            transitioned to sedentary agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago,[15] domesticating plants and animals, thus enabling the 
                            growth of civilization. These human societies subsequently expanded, establishing various forms of government and culture around 
                            the world, and unifying people within regions to form states and empires. The rapid advancement of scientific and medical understanding 
                            in the 19th and 20th centuries permitted the development of more efficient medical tools and healthier lifestyles, resulting in increased 
                            lifespans and causing the human population to rise exponentially.[better source needed] The global human population is about 7.8 billion in 2021. <br>

                            The genus Homo evolved and diverged from other hominins in Africa several million years ago, after the human clade split from the chimpanzee 
                            lineage of the hominids (great apes) branch of the primates.[26] Modern humans, specifically the subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens, proceeded 
                            to colonize all the continents and larger islands, arriving in Eurasia 125,000–60,000 years ago,[27][28] Australia around 65,000 years ago,the 
                            Americas around 15,000 years ago, and remote islands such as Hawaii, Easter Island, Madagascar, and New Zealand between the years 300 and 1280. <br>
                            Family tree showing the extant hominoids: humans (genus Homo), chimpanzees and bonobos (genus Pan), gorillas (genus Gorilla), orangutans 
                            (genus Pongo), and gibbons (four genera of the family Hylobatidae: Hylobates, Hoolock, Nomascus, and Symphalangus). All except gibbons are hominids.
                            The closest living relatives of humans are chimpanzees and bonobos (genus Pan),[32][33] as well as gorillas (genus Gorilla).[34] 
                            The gibbons (family Hylobatidae) and orangutans (genus Pongo) were the first groups to split from the lineage leading to humans, then gorillas, 
                            and finally, chimpanzees. The splitting date between human and chimpanzee lineages is placed 4–8 million years ago, during the late Miocene epoch.
                            During this split, chromosome 2 was formed from the joining of two other chromosomes, leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared 
                            to 24 for the other apes.[37] <br>
                            The earliest fossils that have been proposed as members of the hominin lineage are Sahelanthropus tchadensis, dating from 7 million years
                            ago; Orrorin tugenensis, dating from 5.7 million years ago; and Ardipithecus kadabba, dating to 5.6 million years ago. From these early 
                            species, the australopithecines arose around 4 million years ago, diverging into robust (Paranthropus) and gracile (Australopithecus) 
                            branches,[38] possibly one of which—such as A. garhi, dating to 2.5 million years ago—is a direct ancestor of the genus Homo.[39]
                            The earliest members of Homo evolved around 2.8 million years ago.[40] H. habilis has been considered the first species for which there 
                            is clear evidence of the use of stone tools.[41] Nonetheless, the brains of H. habilis were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, 
                            and their main adaptation was bipedalism. During the next million years a process of encephalization began, and with the arrival of Homo 
                            erectus in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled. H. erectus were the first of the hominina to leave Africa, between 1.3 to 1.8 
                            million years ago. One population, also sometimes classified as a separate species Homo ergaster, stayed in Africa and evolved into Homo 
                            sapiens. It is believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex tools.
                            Although the narratives of human evolution are often contentious, several discoveries since 2010 show that human evolution should not be seen 
                            as a simple linear or branched progression, but a mix of related species.[42][43][44] In fact, genomic research has shown that hybridization 
                            between substantially diverged lineages is the rule, not the exception, in human evolution.[45] Furthermore, it is argued that hybridization 
                            was an essential creative force in the emergence of modern humans.[45]
                            The earliest transitional fossils between H. ergaster/erectus and archaic humans are from Africa, such as Homo rhodesiensis, but seemingly 
                            transitional forms have also been found in Dmanisi, Georgia. These descendants of H. erectus spread through Eurasia c. 500,000 years ago, 
                            evolving into H. antecessor, H. heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis. Fossils of anatomically modern humans that date from the Middle 
                            Paleolithic (about 200,000 years ago) include the Omo-Kibish I remains of Ethiopia[46][47][48] and the fossils of Herto Bouri, Ethiopia. 
                            Earlier remains now classified as early Homo sapiens, such as the Jebel Irhoud remains from Morocco and the Florisbad Skull from South Africa, 
                            have been dated to about 300,000 and 259,000 years old respectively.[49][5][50][51][52][53] Fossil records of archaic Homo sapiens from Skhul 
                            in Israel and Southern Europe begin around 90,000 years ago.[54] <br>

                            As early Homo sapiens dispersed, it encountered varieties of archaic humans both in Africa and in Eurasia, in Eurasia notably Homo 
                            neanderthalensis. Since 2010, evidence for gene flow between archaic and modern humans during the period of roughly 100,000 to 30,000 
                            years ago has been discovered. This includes modern human admixture in Neanderthals, Neanderthal admixture in all modern humans outside 
                            Africa,[73][74] Denisova hominin admixture in Melanesians[75] as well as admixture from unnamed archaic humans to some Sub-Saharan African 
                            populations.[76]
                            The "out of Africa" migration of Homo sapiens took place in at least two waves, the first around 130,000 to 100,000 years ago, the second 
                            (Southern Dispersal) around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago,[77][78] resulting in the colonization of Australia around 65–50,000 years ago, 
                            This recent out of Africa migration derived from East African populations, which had become separated from populations migrating to Southern, 
                            Central and Western Africa at least 100,000 years earlier.[82] Modern humans subsequently spread globally, replacing archaic humans 
                            (either through competition or hybridization). By the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic period (50,000 BP), and likely significantly 
                            earlier[8][9][6][7][10][83][84][85] behavioral modernity, including language, music and other cultural universals had developed.[86][87] They 
                            inhabited Eurasia and Oceania by 40,000 years ago, and the Americas at least 14,500 years ago.[88][89]
                            The rise of agriculture, and domestication of animals, led to stable human settlements.
                            Until about 12,000 years ago (the beginning of the Holocene), all humans lived as hunter-gatherers, generally in small nomadic groups known 
                            as band societies, often in caves. The Neolithic Revolution (the invention of agriculture) took place beginning about 10,000 years ago, 
                            first in the Fertile Crescent, spreading through large parts of the Old World over the following millennia, and independently in Mesoamerica 
                            about 6,000 years ago. Access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent human settlements, the domestication of animals and the use of 
                            metal tools for the first time in history.
                            Agriculture and sedentary lifestyle led to the emergence of early civilizations (the development of urban development, complex society, 
                            social stratification and writing) from about 5,000 years ago (the Bronze Age), first beginning in Mesopotamia.[90] The Scientific Revolution, 
                            Technological Revolution and the Industrial Revolution brought such discoveries as imaging technology, major innovations in transport, such 
                            as the airplane and automobile; and energy development, such as coal and electricity.[91] With the advent of the Information Age at the end of 
                            the 20th century, modern humans live in a world that has become increasingly globalized and interconnected. Human population growth and 
                            industrialisation has led to environmental destruction and pollution significantly contributing to the ongoing mass extinction of other 
                            forms of life called the Holocene extinction,[92] which may be further accelerated by global warming in the future.[93] <br>

                            Humanity's unprecedented set of intellectual skills were a key factor in the species' eventual technological advancement and concomitant 
                            domination of the biosphere.[285] Disregarding extinct hominids, humans are the only animals known to teach generalizable information,[286] 
                            innately deploy recursive embedding to generate and communicate complex concepts,[287] engage in the "folk physics" required for competent 
                            tool design,[288][289] or cook food in the wild.[290] Teaching and learning preserves the cultural and ethnographic identity of all the 
                            diverse human societies.[291] Other traits and behaviors that are mostly unique to humans, include starting fires,[292] phoneme 
                            structuring[293] and vocal learning.[294]
                            The division of humans into male and female gender roles has been marked culturally by a corresponding division 
                            of norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power. Cultural differences by gender have 
                            often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women give birth 
                            led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing and caring for children.[295] Gender roles have varied historically, and 
                            challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.[296]
